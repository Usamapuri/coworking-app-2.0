# CalmKaaj - Coworking Space Management System

## Overview

CalmKaaj is a full-stack web application with PWA capabilities designed to manage coworking space operations. The system provides role-based access for different user types including individual members, organization admins, café managers, and enterprise administrators. Members can order food from the café, book meeting rooms, and manage organizational billing, while staff can manage inventory, fulfill orders, and access analytics.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with local strategy and express-session
- **Password Security**: bcrypt for hashing
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket server for live updates
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with role-based access control

### Database Architecture

## Data Flow

### User Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials via login form
2. Passport.js validates against database
3. Session established with role-based permissions
4. Frontend receives user data and redirects based on role
5. Subsequent requests include session cookie for authentication

### Order Processing Flow
1. User browses menu and adds items to cart
2. Cart data persisted in localStorage
3. Checkout process allows billing type selection
4. Order submitted to backend with user/organization details
5. WebSocket notification sent to café managers
6. Status updates broadcast to user in real-time

### Room Booking Flow
1. User selects date, time, and duration
2. System checks room availability
3. Credit cost calculated based on duration
4. Booking confirmed with organization billing if applicable
5. Calendar integration and reminder system activated

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: Database connectivity
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **@radix-ui/react-***: Accessible UI components
- **drizzle-orm**: Database ORM and query builder
- **express-session**: Session management
- **passport**: Authentication middleware

- **ws**: WebSocket server implementation

### Development Dependencies
- **vite**: Build tool and development server
- **typescript**: Type checking and compilation

## Deployment Strategy

### Production Build
- Frontend: Vite builds optimized static assets
- Backend: esbuild bundles Node.js application
- Database: Migrations applied via Drizzle Kit
- PWA: Service worker and manifest for offline functionality

### Environment Configuration
- Database URL required for PostgreSQL connection
- Session secret for secure cookie signing
- Node environment detection for development features
- Replit-specific plugins for development environment

### Scalability Considerations
- Session store can be configured for Redis in production
- WebSocket connections can be scaled with adapter pattern
- Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- Static assets served via CDN in production
