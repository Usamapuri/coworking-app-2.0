5. Subsequent requests include session cookie for authentication

### Order Processing Flow
1. User browses menu and adds items to cart
2. Cart data persisted in localStorage
3. Checkout process allows billing type selection
4. Order submitted to backend with user/organization details
5. WebSocket notification sent to café managers
6. Status updates broadcast to user in real-time

### Room Booking Flow
1. User selects date, time, and duration
2. System checks room availability
3. Credit cost calculated based on duration
4. Booking confirmed with organization billing if applicable

### Environment Configuration
- Database URL required for PostgreSQL connection
- Session secret for secure cookie signing
- Node environment detection for development features
- Replit-specific plugins for development environment

### Scalability Considerations
